### 1. Basics of C++ Functions

- **Function Definition**: What a function is and its basic structure, including the return type, function name, parameter list, and function body.
- **`main()` Function**: The entry point of a C++ program, the purpose of `int main()`, and `return 0` to indicate successful program completion.
- **Function Parameters**: Ways to pass arguments, including by value, by reference, and by pointer.
- **Function Return Values**: Different types of return values and how to use the `return` statement.

### 2. Variable Definition (`int`)

- **Declaring and Defining Variables**: How to declare and define variables, and the concept of variable scope.
- **Initialization**: The importance of initializing variables, differences between `int a = 0;` and `int b(0);`.
- **Variable Naming Conventions**: Rules for valid variable names and common naming conventions.

### 3. Data Types (`int`, `main()`)

- **Basic Data Types**: An introduction to `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `bool`.
- **Type Conversion**: Implicit and explicit type conversion, including the use of `static_cast`.
- **Custom Data Types**: Introduction to `typedef` and `using` keywords for defining aliases.

### 4. Input and Output Streams (`iostream`)

- **Concept of the `iostream` Library**: Introduction to the `iostream` library as part of the C++ Standard Library, which handles input and output functionality.
- **Components of `iostream`**: `cin` and `cout` within `iostream`.
- **Concept of Streams**: The idea of input and output streams and their roles in the flow of data.

### 5. Inputting Data (`cin`) and Outputting Data (`cout`)

- **Using `cin`**: How `cin` reads user input and stores it in variables.
- **Using `cout`**: How `cout` outputs data to the console.
- **Multiple Inputs and Outputs**: Demonstrating repeated use of `cin` and `cout` for continuous input and output.

### 6. Input and Output Operators (`>>` and `<<`)

- **`>>` Input Operator**: How to use the `>>` operator to place input data into a variable.
- **`<<` Output Operator**: How to use the `<<` operator to output data to the console.
- **Chained Operations**: Demonstrating chained use of `>>` and `<<`, such as `cin >> a >> b;` and `cout << a << " " << b;`.

### 7. C++ Standard Library (`std`)

- **Introduction to the Standard Library**: The C++ Standard Library provides a range of common functions, like input/output, math calculations, and string processing.
- **Components of the Standard Library**: Common libraries such as `iostream`, `cmath`, `vector`, and more.
- **How to Use the Standard Library**: How to include standard library header files, such as `#include <iostream>`.

### 8. Namespace (`std`)

- **Concept of Namespaces**: Namespaces are used to avoid naming conflicts; `std` is the namespace for the C++ Standard Library.
- **Using Namespaces**: How to use `std::` to access standard library contents.
- **`using namespace std;`**: How to introduce the entire namespace, along with the pros and cons of using `std` for easier access in small programs.

### 9. `while` Loop for Controlling Multiple Inputs

- **Basic Structure of a `while` Loop**: Loop conditions, loop body, and exit conditions.
- **Using `while` to Read Input**: How to repeatedly read input until the user enters an end signal, like `exit` or `0`.
- **Loop Control**: Using `break` and `continue` to control the flow of the loop.
